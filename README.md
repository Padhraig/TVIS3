## **üî¨ Overview**  
**TVIS3** is a Shiny application for analyzing Type VI Secretion Systems in bacterial genomes. It integrates multiple bioinformatics tools into an interactive graphical interface. The tools selected were chosen based on a pre-determined pipeline, created by Amy J. G. Anderson et al (2023), entitled 'Distribution and diversity of type VI secretion system clusters in Enterobacter bugandensis and Enterobacter cloacae '.

What This App Does
Type VI Secretion Systems Suite offers several features for bioinformatics analysis, including:

## **üöÄ Features**
‚úî **DeepSecE Prediction** ‚Äì Predict secretion systems using deep learning.  
‚úî **SecRet6** ‚Äì Identify T6SS components via BLASTp or HMMsearch.  
‚úî **cblaster GUI** ‚Äì Search homologous gene clusters.  
‚úî **FastTree** ‚Äì Construct phylogenetic trees.  
‚úî **DeepTMHMM** ‚Äì Predict transmembrane helices.  
‚úî **HMMER** ‚Äì Build and search hidden Markov models.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Installation**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install R & Required Packages**
Ensure you have **R (‚â• 4.0.0)** installed. Then install dependencies:

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "shinythemes", "shinyjs", "DT", "reticulate", "callr"))
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**
To download the app, use the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Padhraig/TVIS3.git
cd TVIS3
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the App**
You can now run the Shiny app from the command line (Windows) or terminal (Linux and MacOS)

‚ñ∂ Windows
Open Command Prompt (cmd) and run:

```sh
Rscript "C:/Users/yourusername/PATH To INSTALLATION/TVIS3-app.R"
```

‚ñ∂ Linux / MacOS
Run the following command:

```sh
Rscript "/home/PATH To INSTALLATION/TVIS3-app.R"
```

---

‚ö° Quick Launch as a Command
If you want to run the app without typing the full path every time, follow these steps:

üîπ Linux (Unix-based systems)
Make the script executable:
```sh
chmod +x TVIS3-app.R
```

Move it to a system-wide location:
```sh
sudo mv TVIS3-app.R /usr/local/bin/tvis3
```

Now, you can run the app simply by typing:
```sh
tvis3
```

üîπ Windows
Create a batch file (tvis3.bat):
Open Notepad, paste the following
```sh
@echo off
Rscript "C:/Users/yourusername/PATH To INSTALLATION/TVIS3-app.R"
```
Save it as tvis3.bat in a directory that is in your system PATH (e.g., C:\Windows\System32).

Now, you can launch the app by typing:
```sh
tvis3
```

Dependencies
TVIS3 integrates multiple bioinformatics tools. Ensure these dependencies are installed before running the app:
